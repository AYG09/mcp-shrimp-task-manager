Decompose complex tasks into independent subtasks, establish dependencies and priorities.

## updateMode

- **append**: Retain existing tasks and add new tasks
- **overwrite**: Delete incomplete tasks, retain completed tasks
- **selective**: Intelligently match and update existing tasks based on task names
- **clearAllTasks**: Clear all tasks and create a backup (preferably use this mode)

## Key Requirements

- **Provide concise pseudocode**: Only provide high-level logic flow and key steps avoiding complete code
- **Integrate when necessary**: Simple modifications can be integrated with other tasks, avoid having too many tasks
- **Submit in batches**: When there are too many tasks, use the "split_tasks" tool, parameters not exceeding 5000 characters
